[00:12.78] Her lips were waitin'
[00:15.18] Her eyes looked sad
[00:18.45] The dreams of a lifetime
[00:21.24] A year gone bad
[00:28.74] 
[00:36.99] The dreams of a lifetime
[00:39.65] Told me wrong
[00:42.62] Everything is all right
[00:45.80] And now it's gone
[00:54.30] 
[00:48.85] Don't blame me
[00:54.83] Please be strong
[00:58.92] I know I'm not wrong
[01:08.92] 
[01:06.44] Here comes the nighttime
[01:08.98] Lookin' for a little more
[01:12.15] Waitin' on the right time
[01:15.39] Somebody outside the door
[01:27.89] 
[01:18.35] Don't blame me
[01:24.84] Please be strong
[01:28.79] I know I'm not wrong
[01:38.79] 
[01:55.59] Her lips were waitin'
[01:58.06] Her eyes looked sad
[02:01.04] The dreams of a lifetime
[02:04.01] A year gone bad
[02:11.51] 
[02:07.34] Don't blame me
[02:12.86] Please be strong
[02:17.35] I know I'm not wrong
