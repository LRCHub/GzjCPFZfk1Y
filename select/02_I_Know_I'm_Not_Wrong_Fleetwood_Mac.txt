One, two, three, four

Here comes the night, here comes the night
Lookin' for a little more
Lookin' on the right time
Somebody outside the door
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
Don't have to be so strong
You know it's not easy, I know I'm not wrong

Here comes the night, here comes the night
Lookin' for a little more
Lookin' on the right time
Somebody outside the door
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
Don't have to be so strong
You know it's not easy, I know I'm not wrong

Don't have to be so strong
You know it's not easy, I know I'm not wrong
Don't-
You know it's not easy, I know I'm not wrong
